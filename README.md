EDA Assistant: AI-Driven Econometric Dashboard
Designed by Jit | Powered by Econometrics and AI
EDA Assistant is a powerful and intuitive Streamlit app for real-time Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression modeling, AI-enhanced insights, and economic policy shock simulations. Unlike legacy tools like Stata or SPSS, this assistant brings a modern, AI-driven approach to econometricsâ€”complete with intelligent visualizations and model interpretation through NLP.

Features
Interactive Visualizations
Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, line charts, and pie charts with real-time hover and plotly interactivity.

Multiple Regression Models

OLS, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Logistic, PCA-based regression

Tree-based models: Decision Tree, Random Forest

Forecasting: ARIMA, VAR

NLP-Based Model Explanation
Real-time AI-powered text summaries using the T5 Transformer model.

âš¡ Economic Policy Shock Simulation
Apply manual shocks to any variable and observe how data would respond under counterfactual scenarios.

ðŸ“š Diagnostic Tools

Breusch-Pagan test for heteroskedasticity

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for multicollinearity

How to Use
1. Upload a dataset
Supported formats: .csv, .xlsx, .json, .dta (Stata)

2. Visualize any column
Choose a variable to generate graphs and get instant AI-generated descriptions.

3. Run regression models
Select a dependent and one or more independent variables. Pick from a range of models.

4. Apply economic shocks
Test how changes in one variable (e.g., inflation, trade) could impact your dataset.
